# HiLo
The rules are simple:
You begin with 300 points. 
A card is drawn. It will have a number between 1 and 13 on it.
You guess if the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card.
The next card is then revealed.
For every card guessed correctly, you receive 100 points.
Each time you guess incorrectly, you lose 75 points.
After each guess, if you still have points, you may continue playing.
If, during your play you reach 0 points, the game is over.



## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
